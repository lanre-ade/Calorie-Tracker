*******User can click the date text to bring up a date picker dialog and select a different date**********


On application startup, user is brought to the start screen which displays a list of saved entries for the current day.
Below the application title bar is the daily calorie count and below that is the date (by default set to current date). 

*******User can click the date text to bring up a date picker dialog and select a different date**********

Its really cool :)

On selection of a new date, the list is refreshed with entries from the newly selected date (if they exist).

At the botom of the screen are two buttons, "Add Entry" and "View Complete Log." As its name implies, "Add Entry" brings
up a dialog box to add a new entry while "View Complete Log" takes user to a list of all saved entries (sorted by date). 
Here, the user can also see other details like total calories of all entries, the number of days logged and the average
calories consumed from the date of first entry till date of last entry date.

A new entry consists of a date (which can be set by the date picker) a field for the description of the meal and the amount
of calories in the meal. The amount of calories in the meal can be directly input or the user could give the app the 
calories per quantity of serving and the units of serving consumed and let the app do the rest. Throughout the app, any 
saved entry in a list can be clicked to bring up the edit entry dialog box. This dialog box gives the user the option of 
simply editing an entry or outright deletion of the entry.
